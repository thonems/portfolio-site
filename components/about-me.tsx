        I hold a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from Høyskolen
        Kristiania, where I specialized in backend technologies such as .NET,
        Java, C and SQL. In my free time, I enjoy playing games with friends,
        watching movies, and playing with innovative technologies. Let’s create
        something amazing together!
