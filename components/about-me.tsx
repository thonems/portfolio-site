        I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from
        Høyskolen Kristiania, where I specialized in backend development. My
        expertise includes working with technologies like .NET, Java, C, and
        SQL. I’m a lifelong learner who loves diving into new tools and
        frameworks, always aiming to build something exceptional.
